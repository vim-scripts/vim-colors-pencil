iA Writer is an elegant word processor, marred only by its lack of Vim. It does have a nice colorscheme, however. 

The pencil color scheme features:

* Subtle indicators of changes in the gutter for Signify, git-gutter, etc.
* Use for both code and prose, though its definitely geared towards the latter
* Light and dark variants
* iTerm color scheme available, for use in terminal-based Vim

Use just like any other colorscheme:

:colorscheme pencil

It has both dark and light variants:

:set background=dark
:set background=light

Differences with iA Writer: most notably, the # heading text is shaded blue. This compensates for the lack of a visual cue found in iA Writer where the heading indicators are inside the left margin. Here we use color instead.

A corresponding iTerm color scheme to enable use of this color scheme with terminal-based Vim can be found at https://github.com/mattly/iterm-colors-pencil
