> A light (and dark) color scheme for Vim inspired by iA Writer

![markdown-example](screenshots/markdown-example2.png)

## Features

iA Writer is an elegant word processor, marred only by its lack of Vim. It
does have a nice color scheme, however.

The _pencil_ color scheme features: 

* Subtle indicators of changes in the gutter for Signify, git-gutter, etc.
* Use for both code and prose, though it’s definitely geared towards the
  latter
* Light and dark variants
* iTerm color scheme [available][it] for using this color scheme with terminal-based Vim

## Requirements

Currently requires vim >= 7.0

## Installation

Install using Pathogen, Vundle, Neobundle, or your favorite Vim package
manager.

Or simply copy the color scheme file to your `~/.vim/colors` directory.

## Configuration

### Contrast

If you’re looking for greater contrast, set the following in your
`.vimrc`:

```
let g:pencil_higher_contrast_ui = 0   " 0=low (def), 1=high
```

It currently only affects the blacks and grays.

### Parentheses matching

Those users who find the parentheses matching disconcerting can disable
this default Vim plugin in their `.vimrc` with:

```
let loaded_matchparen = 1
```

See `:help pi_paren.txt` for more details. 

## Usage

Just like any other color scheme:

```vim
:colorscheme pencil
```

You can toggle between the light and dark variants:

```vim
:set background=dark
:set background=light
```

## Differences

Most notably, the ‘#’ heading text is shaded blue. This compensates for
the lack of a visual cue found in iA Writer where the heading indicators
are inside the left margin. Here we use color instead.

## Font choices

iA Writer uses a typeface called ‘Nitti Light’ by Blue Monday. ($)

Free alternatives with **bold** and _italic_ support include:

* [Anonymous Pro](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Anonymous+Pro) (serif)
* [Courier Prime](http://quoteunquoteapps.com/courierprime/) (serif)
* [Cousine](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Cousine)
* [DejaVu Sans Mono](http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Download)
* [Liberation](https://fedorahosted.org/liberation-fonts/)
* [Luxi Mono Regular](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Luxi-Mono) (serif)
* [Ubuntu Mono](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Ubuntu+Mono)

Cousine is a good match for Nitti Light.
